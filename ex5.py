### Discussion of Results:

The Priority Queue Linked List implementation** is faster than the Priority Queue Heap by approximately a factor of 10
The main reason for this is the difference in dequeue operations between the two implementations:
- In the Linked List dequeueing is a constant time operation O(1) because the smallest element is always at the head of the list. Removing it does not require any restructuring.
- In the Heap , dequeueing takes O(log n) time because after removing the smallest element (the root of the heap), the heap must maintain its shape and order. This requires a reheapification process (heapify-down), which adds computational overhead.

In this experiment, the Priority Queue Linked List implementation outperformed the Priority Queue Heap implementation** in terms of total execution time.
